This base class helps with common setup and teardown tasks for your tests, including:
This base class helps with common setup and teardown tasks for your tests, including:

Reading configuration properties from a file.
Initializing the WebDriver based on the browser specified in the config file.
Maximizing the browser window.
Setting implicit wait time.
Navigating to the base URL.
Closing the browser after test execution.
Prerequisites:

Java installed.
Selenium WebDriver libraries downloaded and configured in your project.

BaseClass.java
This class provides the following functionalities:

Properties:
props: A static Properties object used to store configuration values from the config file.
driver: A static WebDriver object used to interact with the browser.
Constructor:
Reads configuration properties from config.properties file located in the config folder.
initialization() method:
Sets up the WebDriver based on the browser name specified in the config file.
Maximizes the browser window.
Sets implicit wait time.
Navigates to the base URL specified in the config file.
@AfterClass teardown() method:
Closes the browser after test execution.
Configuration File (Optional)
The config.properties file (located in the config folder) can be used to store configuration values such as base URL and browser name. This allows for easy configuration changes without modifying the code itself.

Example config.properties:
browser=chrome
url=https://www.germany-is-calling.com/

Usage
Extend the BaseClass in your test classes.
Override the initialization() method if you need to customize the setup process.
Use the driver object in your test methods to interact with the browser.

Running Tests:

Use a testing framework like TestNG to run your test classes. The @AfterClass teardown method in the BaseClass will ensure the browser is closed after each test execution.

SignInPage:
This file contains the SignInPage class, which represents the Sign In page within the GermanyIsCalling application. It utilizes the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for efficient and maintainable test automation.

Dependencies

Selenium WebDriver (version not specified, but assumed to be compatible)
BaseClass.java (assumed to be a custom base class for common WebDriver functionalities)
Class Structure

Constructor:
Initializes the SignInPage object using PageFactory.initElements.
Locators:
WebElements are identified using @FindBy annotations with XPath expressions.
Ac: Button to accept cookies (if present)
log: Login/Signup button
Emaillog: Email input field
Passwordlog: Password input field
logClick: Login button
Methods:
clickonlog(): Accepts cookies (if applicable) and clicks the Login/Signup button.
loginBtn(String en, String pass): Performs login with provided email (en) and password (pass).
SignInPage sip = new SignInPage(); // Create an instance of SignInPage

// Assuming en and pass are valid email and password credentials
sip.clickonlog();
sip.loginBtn(en, pass);
Consider using a more robust locator strategy (e.g., combining XPath with CSS selectors) for increased element identification reliability.
If applicable, explore using a framework like Page Factory for managing Page Objects.
Employ proper logging mechanisms (e.g., using a logger class) to track actions and errors during test execution.
Adhere to best practices for test automation code structure, readability, and maintainability.
